### Notes: -
1.	With Join, multiple tables have been joined with FACT table to determine a better overall visualization.
2.	The main objective of this visualization is to create a live dashboard for on the go statistics of how each sub-category is doing with respect to sales, profits, region and priority.
3.	Please note that if a sheet has only one value, please go to the dashboard and click on the empty
container or tap on the ‘ESC’ key to revert the changes.

### Total sales for each product sub category:
1.	Shows the total sales for each product sub category sorted from highest to lowest.
2.	The sales amount is shown in text as well as in color from highest to lowest. Sales is also shown in $
amount and displayed in ‘K’ units and can be modified in the Default properties  Number format.
3.	We can identify which product sub category is doing poorest which is clearly ‘Supplies’.

### Graphical sales with profit margin
1.	Shows the total sales for each product sub category sorted from highest to lowest with profit margin color coded, sorted by each Year.
2.	This sheet was added to be shown in the Dashboard for a visual representation for each product sub category sales per year.
3.	We can analyze how each sub-category’s profits are. By understanding this visual representation can tell us if a particular state is doing well in sales even though the region that state belongs to isn’t doing well by looking at the Map in the next sheet.

### Order Priority for each sub category map
1.	Here, we can analyze the order priority of each product sub category based on the region it belongs too. It is color coded as well as it is shown in a map visual representation.
2.	It’s fairly simple to drag and drop custom measures such as color, size and label.

### Profits for year 2014 per each quarter per region
1.	Here, let us take the year 2014 alone by adding a filter. We can then analyze the profit margins for each quarter based on the region it belongs too.
2.	The profit margins are color coded for a better visual representation by dragging a measure across a mark.
3.	This helps us better understand during which quarter profits were high in a particular region. It would better determine how to market certain products at certain regions based on interest by the people.

## DASHBOARD

### Live Statistics
1. We have taken the first 3 sheets for implementing this Dashboard. By adding custom actions we can click on any product sub category and it will then display the profit margin for that sub category as well as the Map with the overall priority for that state.
